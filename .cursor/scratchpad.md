# Farcaster Miniapp Conversion Project

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to convert the existing "Raid-shooter" game into a miniapp that can be played on Farcaster using minikit. This would allow the game to be embedded directly in Farcaster social feeds and take advantage of the decentralized social protocol features.

**URGENT: 48-HOUR TIMELINE - MVP FOCUS**

**Current State:**
- HTML5 canvas-based space shooter game
- 13 enemy types, 5 powerups, parallax backgrounds
- Touch controls with joysticks
- Locally stored stats
- Final size: 13,278 bytes (compact)
- Uses vanilla JavaScript with modular architecture

**Target State (MVP for 48 hours):**
- Basic Farcaster Frame with embedded game
- Core game functionality preserved
- Social context integration (username display)
- Mobile-optimized for Farcaster feeds
- Quick deployment ready

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### **RAPID DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**

**PRIORITY 1 (First 24 hours):**
- ✅ Get game running in Next.js environment
- ✅ Implement basic Frame specification
- ✅ Deploy working prototype

**PRIORITY 2 (Second 24 hours):**
- ✅ Add social context integration
- ✅ Optimize for mobile/social feeds
- ✅ Test and deploy final version

**SKIP FOR NOW (Post-48hrs):**
- Onchain features
- Advanced social features
- Push notifications
- Comprehensive testing

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Project Status**: **RAPID DEVELOPMENT MODE - PHASE 2 COMPLETE**
**Timeline**: 48 hours from start
**Current Phase**: Game Integration Complete - Testing MVP
**Next Action**: Debug any issues and deploy MVP

**Completed in last 2 hours:**
- ✅ Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Farcaster minikit SDK integration
- ✅ Game files migrated to Next.js structure
- ✅ Game component created with React lifecycle
- ✅ Frame specification implemented
- ✅ Social context integration (username display)
- ✅ Mobile-responsive styling added
