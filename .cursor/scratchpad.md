✅ **Task 2 COMPLETED** - Examined entity system components

**Entity Architecture:**
- **Common Pattern**: All entities follow constructor → update() → render() lifecycle
- **Composition-Based**: Uses object composition rather than inheritance
- **Array Management**: Entities stored in global arrays ($.enemies, $.bullets, etc.)
- **Collision Detection**: Distance-based collision using `$.util.distance()` and `$.util.arcInRect()`
- **Viewport Culling**: Entities track `inView` state to optimize rendering

**Core Entity Types:**

1. **Hero** (player):
   - Position: Center of game world ($.ww/2, $.wh/2)
   - Movement: WASD input with acceleration/deceleration physics
   - Weapon System: Configurable fire rate, spread, bullet count, damage
   - Health: Life value with damage feedback visual effects
   - Collision: Takes damage from enemy contact

2. **Enemy** (13 types):
   - **Behavior-Driven**: Each type has unique behavior function
   - **Spawning**: Spawn from screen edges with different patterns
   - **AI Types**: Straight movement, diagonal, homing, splitters, wanderers, stealthy, etc.
   - **Scaling**: Difficulty increases with level progression
   - **Health Bar**: Visual health indicator when damaged
   - **Death Effects**: Explosions, particles, score popups on destruction

3. **Bullet** (projectiles):
   - **Physics**: Direction-based movement with trail rendering
   - **Damage System**: Configurable damage, piercing capabilities
   - **Collision**: Tracks hit enemies to prevent multi-hit
   - **Visual Effects**: Particle trails and hit effects

4. **Powerup** (5 types):
   - **Types**: Health Pack, Slow Enemies, Fast Shot, Triple Shot, Pierce Shot
   - **Collection**: Proximity-based collection with particle effects
   - **Timers**: Time-limited effects tracked in $.powerupTimers array
   - **Visual**: Text-based UI with colored backgrounds

5. **Explosion** (death effects):
   - **Lifecycle**: Tick-based animation with expanding radius
   - **Rendering**: Stroke circles with particle effects
   - **Audio**: Different sounds for normal vs slow-motion explosions

6. **Particle System**:
   - **ParticleEmitter**: Spawns particles in patterns (circular, directional)
   - **Particle**: Individual physics-based particles with friction
   - **Effects**: Used for bullets, explosions, damage, collection feedback

**Entity Relationships:**
- Hero shoots Bullets → Bullets hit Enemies → Enemies spawn Explosions & Particles
- Enemies drop Powerups → Hero collects Powerups → Powerups modify Hero weapon
- All entities interact through collision detection and shared game state

✅ **Task 3 COMPLETED** - Analyzed game mechanics and physics

**Physics System:**
- **Delta Time**: Frame-rate independent physics using `$.dt` (delta time)
- **Movement**: Velocity-based movement with `x += vx * $.dt, y += vy * $.dt`
- **Acceleration**: Hero uses acceleration/deceleration with friction (0.9 multiplier)
- **Friction**: Particles and bullets use friction to slow down over time
- **Bounds**: Entities constrained to world boundaries ($.ww x $.wh = 1600x1200)

**Collision Detection:**
- **Distance-based**: `$.util.distance()` for circle-circle collisions (hero vs enemies, bullets vs enemies)
- **Rectangle collision**: `$.util.rectInRect()` for powerup collection
- **Point-in-rectangle**: `$.util.pointInRect()` for UI and bounds checking
- **Arc-in-rectangle**: `$.util.arcInRect()` for viewport culling optimization
- **Precision**: All collision detection accounts for entity radii and boundaries

**Enemy Spawning & AI:**
- **Spawn System**: Time-based spawning using `Math.floor($.tick) % timeCheck === 0`
- **Spawn Points**: Enemies spawn from 4 screen edges (top, right, bottom, left)
- **Behavior Functions**: Each enemy type has unique behavior() function defining movement patterns
- **AI Types**: Straight line, diagonal, homing, circling, wandering, growing, splitting
- **Slow Motion**: Global `$.slow` flag divides enemy speeds by `$.slowEnemyDivider` (3)

**Level Progression:**
- **Kill Requirements**: Each level needs specific kill count (10 + (level+1) * 7)
- **Enemy Distribution**: Time intervals for spawning each enemy type
- **Difficulty Scaling**: `$.levelDiffOffset` increases enemy life (+0.25), speed (+0.25), value (+5)
- **Dynamic Levels**: After predefined levels, difficulty continues scaling automatically

**Powerup System:**
- **Timer-based**: All powerups last 300 ticks (5 seconds at 60fps)
- **Health Pack**: Gradual health regeneration (+0.001/tick)
- **Slow Enemies**: Divides enemy speeds by 3
- **Fast Shot**: Increases fire rate (5→2) and bullet speed (10→14)
- **Triple Shot**: Changes bullet count (1→3) with spread pattern
- **Pierce Shot**: Enables bullet piercing through multiple enemies
- **Spawn Rate**: 10% chance on enemy death, health pack only spawns when health < 90%

**Game Rules:**
- **Health System**: Hero starts with 1.0 life, loses 0.0075 per enemy contact
- **Scoring**: Points based on enemy values (5-65 points per enemy type)
- **Game Over**: Triggered when hero.life <= 0 with 200-tick death animation
- **Weapon System**: Configurable fire rate, spread, damage, speed, piercing
- **Mouse Aiming**: Hero direction follows mouse position with `Math.atan2(dy, dx)`

**Screen & Camera:**
- **Viewport**: 800x600 visible area in 1600x1200 world
- **Camera Following**: Smooth camera tracking with easing (division by 30)
- **Parallax Scrolling**: 4 background layers move at different speeds
- **Screen Shake**: Rumble system with decay (0.4) for impact feedback

**Physics Constants:**
- **Hero**: acceleration=0.5, vmax=6, friction=0.9, radius=10
- **Bullets**: speed=10-14, friction=0.75, damage=1, size=15
- **Enemies**: Various speeds (0.25-6), radii (5-80), health (1-10)
- **Particles**: friction=0.85, speeds=2-25, viewport culling for performance
