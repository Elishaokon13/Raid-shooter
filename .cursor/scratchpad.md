## Current Status / Progress Tracking
✅ **Task 1 COMPLETED** - Analyzed main game entry point and initialization

**Key Findings:**
- **Entry Point**: Game initializes via `window.addEventListener('load', $.init)` in game.js
- **Architecture**: Uses a global `$` object as the main namespace containing all game systems
- **Canvas System**: Multi-layered rendering with 6 canvases:
  - `cbg1-cbg4`: Background layers for parallax effects (different sizes for depth)
  - `cmg`: Main game canvas (midground) - 800x600px
  - `cfg`: Foreground overlay canvas
- **Main Game Loop**: `$.loop()` function using `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps rendering
- **State Management**: Game state system with states: 'menu', 'play', 'pause', 'gameover', 'stats', 'credits'
- **Entity System**: Array-based entity management for enemies, bullets, explosions, powerups, particles, textPops, etc.
- **Input System**: Keyboard (WASD/Arrow keys, F, P, M) and mouse handling with pressed/state tracking
- **Audio System**: Integration with jsfxr for procedural sound effects
- **Storage System**: localStorage wrapper for persistent game data (scores, settings, stats)

**Core Initialization Flow:**
1. `$.init()` → Setup DOM elements, canvases, storage, input handling
2. `$.reset()` → Initialize game state variables and create hero
3. `$.bindEvents()` → Attach keyboard/mouse event handlers  
4. `$.setupStates()` → Define game state functions
5. `$.renderBackground1-4()` → Pre-render static background layers
6. `$.setState('menu')` → Set initial game state
7. `$.loop()` → Start main game loop

✅ **Task 2 COMPLETED** - Examined entity system components

**Entity Architecture:**
- **Common Pattern**: All entities follow constructor → update() → render() lifecycle
- **Composition-Based**: Uses object composition rather than inheritance
- **Array Management**: Entities stored in global arrays ($.enemies, $.bullets, etc.)
- **Collision Detection**: Distance-based collision using `$.util.distance()` and `$.util.arcInRect()`
- **Viewport Culling**: Entities track `inView` state to optimize rendering

**Core Entity Types:**

1. **Hero** (player):
   - Position: Center of game world ($.ww/2, $.wh/2)
   - Movement: WASD input with acceleration/deceleration physics
   - Weapon System: Configurable fire rate, spread, bullet count, damage
   - Health: Life value with damage feedback visual effects
   - Collision: Takes damage from enemy contact

2. **Enemy** (13 types):
   - **Behavior-Driven**: Each type has unique behavior function
   - **Spawning**: Spawn from screen edges with different patterns
   - **AI Types**: Straight movement, diagonal, homing, splitters, wanderers, stealthy, etc.
   - **Scaling**: Difficulty increases with level progression
   - **Health Bar**: Visual health indicator when damaged
   - **Death Effects**: Explosions, particles, score popups on destruction

3. **Bullet** (projectiles):
   - **Physics**: Direction-based movement with trail rendering
   - **Damage System**: Configurable damage, piercing capabilities
   - **Collision**: Tracks hit enemies to prevent multi-hit
   - **Visual Effects**: Particle trails and hit effects

4. **Powerup** (5 types):
   - **Types**: Health Pack, Slow Enemies, Fast Shot, Triple Shot, Pierce Shot
   - **Collection**: Proximity-based collection with particle effects
   - **Timers**: Time-limited effects tracked in $.powerupTimers array
   - **Visual**: Text-based UI with colored backgrounds

5. **Explosion** (death effects):
   - **Lifecycle**: Tick-based animation with expanding radius
   - **Rendering**: Stroke circles with particle effects
   - **Audio**: Different sounds for normal vs slow-motion explosions

6. **Particle System**:
   - **ParticleEmitter**: Spawns particles in patterns (circular, directional)
   - **Particle**: Individual physics-based particles with friction
   - **Effects**: Used for bullets, explosions, damage, collection feedback

**Entity Relationships:**
- Hero shoots Bullets → Bullets hit Enemies → Enemies spawn Explosions & Particles
- Enemies drop Powerups → Hero collects Powerups → Powerups modify Hero weapon
- All entities interact through collision detection and shared game state

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Task 2 completed successfully. The entity system is well-structured with clear separation of concerns:

**Key Technical Insights:**
- Uses composition over inheritance for flexible entity design
- Collision detection is optimized with viewport culling
- Entity lifecycle management is consistent across all types
- The particle system provides rich visual feedback
- Enemy AI uses behavior functions for varied gameplay

**Next Steps Available:**
- Task 3: Game mechanics and physics analysis
- Task 4: Audio system examination  
- Task 5: UI/interaction systems documentation
- Task 6: Data persistence review

Ready to proceed with any of these tasks.

## Lessons
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Include info useful for debugging in program output
- If vulnerabilities appear in terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using -force git command
- Entity systems can be implemented effectively using composition and arrays rather than complex inheritance hierarchies
- Viewport culling with `inView` flags significantly improves performance for off-screen entities
