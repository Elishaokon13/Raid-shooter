# Raid-shooter Codebase Analysis

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to understand the Raid-shooter codebase - a space-themed shoot 'em up game built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The game features:
- 13 enemy types
- 5 powerups  
- Parallax backgrounds
- Retro sound effects
- Local storage for stats
- Final size: 13,278 bytes

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Understanding the game architecture and component relationships
- Analyzing the JavaScript modules and their interdependencies
- Documenting the game loop and rendering system
- Understanding the entity system (hero, enemies, bullets, powerups)
- Analyzing the audio system and local storage implementation

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] **Task 1:** Analyze main game entry point and initialization
  - Success criteria: Understand game.js structure and startup flow
- [ ] **Task 2:** Examine entity system components (hero, enemies, bullets, powerups)
  - Success criteria: Document entity classes and their relationships
- [ ] **Task 3:** Analyze game mechanics and physics
  - Success criteria: Understand collision detection, movement, and game rules
- [ ] **Task 4:** Review audio system and effects
  - Success criteria: Document audio.js and jsfxr integration
- [ ] **Task 5:** Examine UI and interaction systems
  - Success criteria: Understand button handling, text rendering, and touch compatibility
- [ ] **Task 6:** Analyze data persistence and storage
  - Success criteria: Document storage.js implementation

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Analyze main game architecture
- [ ] Document entity system
- [ ] Review game mechanics
- [ ] Examine audio system
- [ ] Document UI/interaction systems
- [ ] Review data persistence

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
✅ **Task 1 COMPLETED** - Analyzed main game entry point and initialization

**Key Findings:**
- **Entry Point**: Game initializes via `window.addEventListener('load', $.init)` in game.js
- **Architecture**: Uses a global `$` object as the main namespace containing all game systems
- **Canvas System**: Multi-layered rendering with 6 canvases:
  - `cbg1-cbg4`: Background layers for parallax effects (different sizes for depth)
  - `cmg`: Main game canvas (midground) - 800x600px
  - `cfg`: Foreground overlay canvas
- **Main Game Loop**: `$.loop()` function using `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps rendering
- **State Management**: Game state system with states: 'menu', 'play', 'pause', 'gameover', 'stats', 'credits'
- **Entity System**: Array-based entity management for enemies, bullets, explosions, powerups, particles, textPops, etc.
- **Input System**: Keyboard (WASD/Arrow keys, F, P, M) and mouse handling with pressed/state tracking
- **Audio System**: Integration with jsfxr for procedural sound effects
- **Storage System**: localStorage wrapper for persistent game data (scores, settings, stats)

**Core Initialization Flow:**
1. `$.init()` → Setup DOM elements, canvases, storage, input handling
2. `$.reset()` → Initialize game state variables and create hero
3. `$.bindEvents()` → Attach keyboard/mouse event handlers  
4. `$.setupStates()` → Define game state functions
5. `$.renderBackground1-4()` → Pre-render static background layers
6. `$.setState('menu')` → Set initial game state
7. `$.loop()` → Start main game loop

None at this time - proceeding with initial analysis.

## Lessons
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Include info useful for debugging in program output
- If vulnerabilities appear in terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using -force git command
