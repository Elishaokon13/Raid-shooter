# Raid Shooter Rebuild Project

## Background and Motivation
- Original Raid Shooter is a space-themed shoot 'em up game built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas
- Goal is to modernize the game using Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Add blockchain integration for on-chain features like:
  - NFT rewards for achievements
  - Token-based powerups
  - Leaderboard on blockchain
  - Player stats stored on-chain

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Technical Migration**
   - Converting vanilla JS to React/Next.js components
   - Maintaining game performance in React environment
   - Canvas integration with React
   - State management for game data

2. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Smart contract development for game mechanics
   - Wallet connection and transaction handling
   - Gas optimization for on-chain operations
   - Secure storage of game assets

3. **UI/UX Modernization**
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Modern UI components while maintaining game feel
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Loading states and transitions
