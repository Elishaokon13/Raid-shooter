# Raid-shooter Codebase Analysis

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to understand the Raid-shooter codebase - a space-themed shoot 'em up game built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The game features:
- 13 enemy types
- 5 powerups  
- Parallax backgrounds
- Retro sound effects
- Local storage for stats
- Final size: 13,278 bytes

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Understanding the game architecture and component relationships
- Analyzing the JavaScript modules and their interdependencies
- Documenting the game loop and rendering system
- Understanding the entity system (hero, enemies, bullets, powerups)
- Analyzing the audio system and local storage implementation

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] **Task 1:** Analyze main game entry point and initialization
  - Success criteria: Understand game.js structure and startup flow
- [ ] **Task 2:** Examine entity system components (hero, enemies, bullets, powerups)
  - Success criteria: Document entity classes and their relationships
- [ ] **Task 3:** Analyze game mechanics and physics
  - Success criteria: Understand collision detection, movement, and game rules
- [ ] **Task 4:** Review audio system and effects
  - Success criteria: Document audio.js and jsfxr integration
- [ ] **Task 5:** Examine UI and interaction systems
  - Success criteria: Understand button handling, text rendering, and touch compatibility
- [ ] **Task 6:** Analyze data persistence and storage
  - Success criteria: Document storage.js implementation

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Analyze main game architecture
- [ ] Document entity system
- [ ] Review game mechanics
- [ ] Examine audio system
- [ ] Document UI/interaction systems
- [ ] Review data persistence

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Starting codebase analysis in Executor mode. Will examine JavaScript files systematically to understand the game's architecture and implementation details.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
None at this time - proceeding with initial analysis.

## Lessons
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- Include info useful for debugging in program output
- If vulnerabilities appear in terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using -force git command
